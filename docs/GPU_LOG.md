# GPU bring-up log (chronological, newest first)

This is the full per-step record that used to be `NOTES.md`: exact images, hashes,
CI runs, phone results and the reasoning at the time. The current state and the next
action are in [NOTES.md](../NOTES.md) and [HANDOFF.md](../HANDOFF.md). Entries that say
"not yet built/booted" were true when written; newer entries supersede them.

## Phone result — 0099 GMU First Start, 2026-10-21 19:42 UTC

- Booted `shim/out/shim-boot-0099-firststart.img` (SHA256 `9f9bc5128459cce5d2ba2cea067479d75dc8aae954093378568f574bedd212eb`), `sweetgpu=16 sweetbattery=1`.
- Built by CI run `39592212501` (success in 7m24s) from commit `f967697b090623f9907f15cb68e64c20f18aa4bc` on fork `zeroninefourfour/ios-extra`.
- Telemetry: 262 KB decoded over UDP port 5140.
- **Measured Hardware Result**:
  `SWEET GPU: first-start started=1 done=1 polls=2 init=0xbabeface busy=0x00000000 reset=0x1 sCR0=0x00200626/0x00200602 GX=0x00222001/0x00222001 restored=1 quarantined=0 result: GMU initialization signature observed; CM3 safely reset`
  - In only 2 polls (200 us), the GMU Cortex-M3 processor ran firmware initialization and signaled `FW_INIT_RESULT = 0xbabeface`!
  - SMMU fault containment (`sCR0` bits GFIE/GCFGFIE) safely shielded the CPU.
  - Safe rollback immediately asserted `CM3_SYSRESET = 1`, restored SMMU `sCR0` and GMU registers. GX remained safe (0x00222001).
  - User confirmed dynamic battery reporting from PM6150 PMIC is working, lock screen unlocked, and home screen responsive.

## Phone result — 0098 IRQ mask/restore, 2026-10-21 19:21 UTC

- Booted `shim/out/shim-boot-0098-irqmask.img` (SHA256 `cfba8f14561037b8d04a9851118b55b363965fac4929aa53aeb62dec4cd7a175`), `sweetgpu=15`.
- Built by CI run `39307039113`.
- User confirmed lock screen and home screen unlock. Both GMU interrupt sources masked and restored cleanly.


## 0098 CI started at handoff — 2026-10-19

- Implementation/checks/handoff commit `edab65c998a917d5e450b730aa4d0ff2e8e6032e` pushed.
- [CI 39307039113](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra/actions/runs/39307039113)
  is **in progress**, not yet verified green. No 0098 download, package, image
  hash or phone result exists. HANDOFF pins this exact run/head and package command.
- User confirmed 0097 home screen and requested documentation before stopping
  for the usage limit. No further phone test was started. All run evidence and
  first-start blockers are preserved; repository working tree is clean after
  the documentation commit.

## Handoff — 0098 local implementation, 2026-10-19

- User confirmed the 0097 home screen and requested all work documented before
  stopping for the usage limit. No further phone boot is authorized in this session.
- `0098-sweet-gpu-exact-ao-mask-readback.patch`, same mode 15, baseline c242eb7
  (measured 0097), accepts only offset +0x24c18 / write 0xffffffff / read 0x3f.
  Mainline write value stays unchanged. All other set/restore comparisons exact.
- Normal and ASan/UBSan suites pass: exact AO tuple; all six missing AO bits,
  unexpected AO high bits/full all-ones, every missing HFI bit and HFI=0x3f
  refused (42 alternatives); all 20 zero-write preconditions and previous
  set/restore/quarantine/full-chain/mode/replay cases retained.
  Arm64 compile 0 of 1 failed; patch equals isolated diff. Full CI and phone
  validation pending at implementation. No 0098 image exists yet.
- Next: verify push-triggered CI and its exact source, package mode 15, always
  check fastboot first, then measure the second mask. HANDOFF has commands and
  full first-start draft review, including SMMU global-fault IRQ containment.

## Phone result — 0097 IRQ mask/restore, 2026-10-19 18:53 UTC

- Always checked fastboot first: exactly one already present, serial redacted.
  Announced first mask writes and temporarily booted once at 18:53:52 UTC;
  send 0.423s, boot 0.134s, total 0.563s. Ping succeeds. **User confirmed the home screen.**
- Image `shim/out/shim-boot-0097-irqmask.img`, SHA256
  `9ae01e4289113accd0ad18fcf15e436afd4cfaecc5330e8b69b5b63760f0ca7e`, mode 15;
  source 01dbc6e5571eacdca32f7c0d60bc34ce0d77ab00, green CI 39305068882.
- Capture: 462 UDP packets, 206191 decoded bytes; local/ignored
  `ios-extra-work/logs/phone-0097-irqmask.{pcap,txt}` plus sanitized fastboot log.
  Initial report 0 partial; raw values below from complete cached report 1.
- **Stopped at the intended readback guard:** AO mask +0x24c18, wrote all ones,
  read 0x3f. Restored it to 0. attempted=1, masked=0 (strict full-word match
  failed), restored=1, quarantined=0. GMU2HOST mask was never written.
  All six final preflight values match 0096, reset/busy/init=1/0/0 and
  GX unchanged 0x00222001. No CM3 execution or GX power.
- Lower checks pass: RSC wake ACK=3/BUSY=0, stop=0x01010006 and state restored;
  buffer ATOS 29/29, inactive=1 and known inert S2CR/CBAR residue, FSR/sGFSR=0;
  firmware bad=0, same nine init differences, clock/CX/votes rolled back.
- Mainline XML declares AO status bits 0..5, consistent with the six retained mask
  bits. It does not define a mask writable-width field. Next patch accepts only
  the specific measured tuple (+0x24c18, wrote=0xffffffff, got=0x3f), still writes
  the mainline all-ones value, and proceeds to test GMU2HOST masking. No broad
  ignored-bit policy or hardware-vs-filtering ownership claim is justified.

- Always checked fastboot first: exactly one already present, serial redacted.
  Announced first interrupt-mask writes/restore with CM3 reset and performed the
  authorized single temporary boot. Capture/result recorded separately above.
- Pruned reproducible 0093/0094 kernel/buildtree/image/payload/unpack artifacts;
  all phone logs/manifests retained, along with 0095/0096/0097 working artifacts.

## Implementation — 0097 interrupt mask/restore (local checks pass)

- `0097-sweet-gpu-irq-mask-restore.patch`, mode 15, baseline 328cafb (0096).
  Separately tests all-ones AO and GMU2HOST masks and restores both zero defaults,
  with CM3 still held reset. Exact six-word 0096 cached/live state and fresh
  reset/busy/init/GX gates precede all new writes. No clears or CM3/GX controls.
- Normal/ASan/UBSan host suites pass: all 20 zero-write refusals, exact success
  order, either set/restore failing, status/reset/idle quarantine, other state
  changes, full chain, mode isolation and cached replay. Arm64 0 of 1 failed.
  Patch equals isolated diff; full CI/phone pending.
- Unexpected pending status or reset/idle change triggers best-effort all-ones
  masks and explicit incomplete rollback, without clearing the evidence. Raw final
  reads establish actual mask state. No firmware release is present.

## Phone result — 0096 read-only IRQ/fence preflight, 2026-10-19 18:39 UTC

- Checked fastboot first: exactly one already present, serial redacted. Announced
  and performed one temporary boot at 18:39:28 UTC; send 0.424s, boot 0.134s,
  total 0.565s. Ping succeeds; **user confirmed the home screen**.
- Image `shim/out/shim-boot-0096-irqpreflight.img`, SHA256

  source edd2b796ed7ff02434c42942c490543c17f95456, green CI 39303111412.
- Capture: 461 UDP packets, 198599 decoded bytes, local/ignored
  `ios-extra-work/logs/phone-0096-irqpreflight.{pcap,txt}` and sanitized
  `phone-0096-irqpreflight-fastboot.txt`. Report 0 partial; all six raw values
  below are from complete cached report 1. No panic marker observed.
- Both mask words and both pending-status words are 0; fence control is 0;
  RPMH power state is 0x0f. Source `a6xx_gmu_irq_disable()` masks both sources
  with all ones; our zero defaults must not be assumed safe during execution.
  This dump proves readability, not mask writability or interrupt delivery.
- Lower probes still pass: RSC wake ACK=3/BUSY=0 and stop=0x01010006,
  controls/state restored; pre-boot 29/29; buffer ATOS 29/29, inactive=1 and known
  inert S2CR/CBAR residue only; FSR/sGFSR=0. Firmware bad=0, nine constrained
  init readbacks unchanged, CX/clock/vote cleanup complete. CM3 stayed reset,
  GX remained off. No firmware execution or GPU command.
- Next measured prerequisite: a separate mask/verify/restore test with CM3 held
  reset. Do not combine an unproved mask write with the first CM3 release.

- Checked fastboot first: exactly one device already present, serial redacted.
  Announced and started the authorized single temporary read-only test. Phone
  observations recorded separately after capture; no flash or reboot command.

## Implementation — 0096 read-only IRQ/fence preflight (local checks pass)

- Patch `0096-sweet-gpu-irq-fence-preflight.patch`, mode 14, baseline 4be318c
  (validated 0095). Source audit of `a6xx_gmu_resume()` found interrupt setup
  outside the narrower fw_start sequence used for the 0094 dump; mask defaults
  have not been measured. Read six IRQ/fence/power-state words before first release.
- Normal and ASan/UBSan suites pass, including all 13 zero-write refusals,
  byte-for-byte unchanged MMIO, exact offsets/values (including a legitimate
  all-ones mask), lower-mode exclusion, reset preservation and cached replay.
  Arm64 compile 0 of 1 failed. Isolated diff equals the patch. CI/phone pending.
- No new writes or CM3 release. The larger first-start draft was saved outside Git
  as `ios-extra-work/gmu-first-start-draft.patch`, based on 0095. Local arm64 object
  compilation alone passed for that draft; it has no host/full-CI/phone validation
  and omits interrupt protection. It is not in the repository patch chain or a
  boot image. Rework only after the IRQ/fence measurement.

## Phone result — 0095 RSC wake/stop, 2026-10-19 18:18 UTC

- Checked fastboot first: exactly one device already present, serial redacted.
  Announced the first retention/wake request and performed one temporary boot.
  Boot issued 18:18:46 UTC; send 0.417s, boot 0.134s, total 0.564s; ping succeeds.
  **User confirmed the home screen.** No flash or reboot command.

- Capture: 453 UDP packets, 200503 decoded bytes; local/ignored files
  `ios-extra-work/logs/phone-0095-rscwake.{pcap,txt}` and
  `phone-0095-rscwake-fastboot.txt`. Initial report 0 partial; raw transition below
  is from cached report 1. No panic marker observed.
- **Measured:** retention set/restored 1/0; wake ACK becomes **3** (bit 1 set,
  bit 0 remains set), on poll 2; SEQ_BUSY=0 on poll 1. Stop completes on poll 2,
  STATUS=0x01010006. Before/awake/final STATUS=0x01010006/0x0100000c/0x01010006.
  All six sampled RSC/control words return exactly to their incoming values,
  controls-restored=1 and state-restored=1. CM3 reset stays 1 throughout and
  GX GDSCR stays 0x00222001 (collapsed). No firmware execution or GPU command.
- Lower probes still pass: pre-boot 29/29, buffer ATOS 29/29, mapping inactive=1,
  inert S2CR/CBAR residue only, FSR/sGFSR=0; firmware 8192 words bad=0;
  same nine init differences; CX/clock/vote cleanup complete.
- **Gate passed:** this proves RSC wake, idle completion and return to stop under
  the observed init readbacks. It does not identify which layer owns those
  readbacks, prove every rail vote, or prove a GMU DMA stream. Next separate patch:
  first bounded CM3 firmware start, always reset again before existing rollback.

  Announced TCM retention + RSC wake/stop, with CM3 held reset, then started the
  authorized single temporary test. No flash or reboot command. Phone result
  recorded separately after capture.

## Implementation — 0095 bounded RSC wake/stop (local checks pass)

- Patch `0095-sweet-gpu-rsc-wake-stop.patch`, mode 13; isolated source baseline
  85017d8 (validated 0094). Smaller step 4a before any CM3 release: TCM retention,
  wake ACK bit 1, BUSY=0, return to stop, restore retention. GX snapshots included.
- Every new precondition comes from the fresh lower-mode proof and measured
  stopped state, except GX is gated by powered-off/collapsed field predicates
  rather than an unmeasured whole register value with CX held on. Exactly the nine
  known init signatures are allowed; every tuple field is checked. All polls have
  10 ms bounds. No CM3/GX control or HFI command added.
- Normal/sanitized host suites pass: 57 zero-write refusals, exact write ordering,
  all three handshake timeouts, retention set/restore failures, unexpected GX
  change, reset preservation, replay and lower-mode exclusion. Arm64 compile
  0 of 1 failed; isolated diff equals the patch. CI and phone pending.

## Phone result — 0094 pre-boot GMU dump, 2026-10-19 18:01 UTC

- User confirmed fastboot. First check saw zero devices during USB reconnection;
  the immediate brief retry saw exactly one (serial redacted), then the helper
  rechecked before one temporary boot. No flash or reboot issued.
- Boot issued 18:01:14 UTC; send 0.419s, boot 0.134s, total 0.598s. Ping succeeds;
  **the user confirmed the home screen**. Image
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0094-gmupreboot.img`, SHA256

  mode 12; source 8104c7466c39d66b3169f1c420ac630312c8eb02, CI 39297388718.
- Capture: 462 UDP packets, 191276 decoded bytes; local/ignored files
  `ios-extra-work/logs/phone-0094-gmupreboot.{pcap,txt}` and
  `phone-0094-gmupreboot-fastboot.txt`. Report 0 partial; all 29 pre-boot values,
  29 ATOS results and 20 write/readbacks below are from cached report 1.
  No panic marker observed.
- **Measured:** all 29 registers read successfully. After the lower-mode RSC stop,
  ACK=1 and SEQ_BUSY=1 while REQ=0. This is a stopped-state observation, not a
  failed wake (no wake request has been sent). Power CTRL=0x09c40406 and both
  hysteresis words=0x000a2710; do not assume they start at zero. DTCM version=0,
  CM3 reset=1, busy/init=0, CFG=0x52. Other HFI/log/cache/RPMH configuration=0.
- Buffer checks remain 29/29; final SMR/S2CR/SCTLR/CBAR=0/3/0/0x10000,
  inactive=1/restored=0, FSR/sGFSR=0. Narrow CBAR expected diagnostic is now 0
  (normalization fixed), still reads back 0x10000. Firmware 8192/8192 bad=0;
  RSC init remains 48 writes, 9 known differences, stop status=0x01010006;
  CX and clock cleanup complete. No GMU processor release or GX power.
- **Next measured question:** split step 4 further: mainline's bounded RSC wake
  (ACK bit 1, then SEQ_BUSY=0), return to stop, retain CM3 reset. This tests wake
  with the nine constrained RSC/PDC readbacks before attempting firmware execution.

## 0094 full build and verified image — 2026-10-19

- Full [CI 39297388718](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra/actions/runs/39297388718)
  **passed** on `8104c7466c39d66b3169f1c420ac630312c8eb02`.
- Kernel SHA256 `3622b9ac5798f146a514d54f61c7ae191e8275f238d51f0c95233c724a1d0711`;
  SHA256SUMS check passed. `_sweet_gpu_probe` at 0xfffffe00074fa838 and
  `_sweet_rpmh_arc_set` at 0xfffffe00074f8548. Artifacts local/ignored in
  `ios-extra-work/out-0094` and `ci-0094`.
- CI GPU source SHA256 `3caa2f49b2c160a4d8b5b08621fe6caedc189a5fde334aaed40a1535101d3ad4`;
  staged firmware header `2c76898351726399ac212d29c3ca7670786ad00c77e5be28da3b847af0baedf2`;
  RPMh source `fc3669172ee14592cbee2f4312450e68ca9eac7870612d7d669fa2872bf404ca`.
  All three byte-identical to locally tested isolated files.
- Image `shim/out/shim-boot-0094-gmupreboot.img`, 17268736 bytes, SHA256
  `f1d9e4f9db5f8c468803135b591cf1b1dc9c1dc4d58512f91378746cbb2bf9c0`,
  mode 12, source/CI identity in `shim/out/manifest-0094.json`. Unpacked payload
  and command-line round-trip passed. **Not booted yet.**
- Checked fastboot first (serials not displayed/stored): zero devices; asked the
  user to enter fastboot. No reboot issued. Phone last tested on 0093, whose
  home screen is now confirmed; separate UI limitations are recorded in NOTES.
- Pruned reproducible 0092 kernel/buildtree/image/payload/unpack-check artifacts;
  preserved manifests and all phone logs, working 0093 and pending 0094 artifacts.

## Implementation — 0094 read-only GMU pre-boot inventory (local checks pass)

- `0094-sweet-gpu-gmu-preboot-inventory.patch`, `sweetgpu=12`, isolated baseline
  d3a6423 (validated 0093). 29 source-verified offsets, including DTCM version
  word +0xafe0, cached only after the buffer map is inactive and CM3 reset/idle
  is rechecked. No start writes or processor release.
- Normal and ASan/UBSan host suites pass: 29 offset/value checks, all 8 refusal
  terms with zero writes, missing-map/failed-buffer exclusions, lower-mode
  isolation and replay. Also tests the saved narrow CBAR diagnostic normalization
  against the exact dirty input observed in 0093. Arm64 compile: 0 of 1 failed.
- Full CI and phone result pending; source/build checks do not prove these new
  registers are readable on the phone. Design: GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.

## Phone result — 0093 GMU buffers and ATOS, 2026-10-19 17:43 UTC

- Checked `fastboot devices` first (serial redacted): exactly one device already
  in fastboot. Announced and ran the authorized pending test. The helper rechecked
  before the single temporary boot; no flash or reboot command was issued.
- Boot issued 17:43:38 UTC; send 0.418s, boot 0.138s, total 0.564s; ping succeeds.
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0093-gmubuffers.img`, SHA256
  `dd4f6de48318e94e0dee5933467a998ec9ec6c90f352f9e050168b3202304f7a`,
  mode 11; CI 39293204273, built source ab7a61d (implementation c053da3).
- Capture: 452 UDP packets, 187544 decoded bytes. Local/ignored files:
  `ios-extra-work/logs/phone-0093-gmubuffers.{pcap,txt}` and
  `phone-0093-gmubuffers-fastboot.txt`. Initial report 0 is partial; all 29 ATOS
  results and all 20 write/readbacks below are from cached report 1. No panic
  marker observed. **The user confirmed the home screen.**
  Separately reports missing wallpaper and some white Settings/widgets, compared
  with another image made from ios-sweet patches; comparator identity and cause
  are unverified. User requested continuing GPU bring-up.
- **Measured:** allocation PA 0x104664000, 64 KiB; dummy/debug/log/HFI IOVAs
  0x60000000/0x60001000/0x60005000/0x60009000. All 26 mapped-page endpoints
  translate to the expected 13 physical pages; adjacent/unrelated addresses fault.
  `stage=3 checks=29/29 passed=29 inactive=1 restored=0`. FSR=0, sGFSR=0.
  Final SMR/S2CR/SCTLR/CBAR=0/3/0/0x10000: no active mapping, the known two inert
  restore differences remain. Firmware 8192/8192 words, bad=0; CM3 reset=1.
  CX complete/rolled back; clock stage=8 restored=1. RSC init still has the same
  nine constrained readbacks and successful stop status 0x01010006.
- **Diagnostic limitation measured:** the saved incoming CBAR value promotes to
  `0xfffffe8f00000000` in one `buffers wr` line, although its low 32 bits are 0.
  This is the earlier dirty-upper-bit anomaly now on a *saved expected value*;
  the 0093 explicit AND only normalizes the readback. This is a 32-bit MMIO store
  (low word 0), not a 64-bit write of that displayed value. Preserve the raw line;
  normalize the diagnostic's narrow expected value before comparing/logging in the
  next patch. No change to the known final CBAR=0x10000 observation.
- **Gate passed:** SMMU ATOS verifies the full buffer map. This still does not prove
  GMU-master traffic through stream 5; CM3/GX have never run. Next is the separate
  read-only pre-boot register inventory, before any GMU release.

## 0093 full build and packaged image — 2026-10-19

- User confirmed the repo had been made private overnight and requested public
  visibility again. Restored it and verified `isPrivate=false` / `PUBLIC`.
- Full [CI 39293204273](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra/actions/runs/39293204273)
  **passed** on `ab7a61da02cb91b0f87cf1a372939fabf73e3a59` (implementation c053da3,
  unchanged patch). This is full build/link evidence, not a phone result.
- Kernel `ios-extra-work/out-0093/kernel.development.sweet`, SHA256
  `1baf48029953c7d45b4ff50f3ecec5e0ff21e6bea8bc0525ef2cb6bc435243f5`;
  `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` passed. Symbols `_sweet_gpu_probe` at
  `0xfffffe00074fa838`, `_sweet_rpmh_arc_set` at `0xfffffe00074f8548`.

  `dd4f6de48318e94e0dee5933467a998ec9ec6c90f352f9e050168b3202304f7a`,
  `sweetgpu=11`, existing UFS-root boot arguments. Manifest
  `shim/out/manifest-0093.json`; unpacked ramdisk equals the generated payload,
  boot arguments round-trip exactly. Artifacts are local/ignored.
- **Not booted yet.** Asked for a new user-controlled fastboot before the single
  temporary test. The phone remains on 0092; no flash or reboot was issued.

## Implementation — 0093 GMU buffers (local checks pass; CI skipped)

- Source commit `c053da3cfae8a4fe053499fee7ad01bb68b61cfd`, patch
  `0093-sweet-gpu-gmu-buffers.patch`, mode 11. Design and preconditions in
  `GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`. Isolated source baseline `60d4b0e` is validated 0092;
  its working diff matches the patch byte-for-byte.
- Local arm64 object compile: 0 of 1 files failed. All four Python test suites
  pass normally and with ASan/UBSan. GPU harness checks complete HFI contents at
  cache clean, 29 translations/faults, 38 precondition refusals issuing zero SMMU
  writes, readback failures, TLB/ATOS timeout bounds, incorrect translation/fault,
  rollback and replay. These are host results, not phone observations.
- [CI 39290944708](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra/actions/runs/39290944708)
  **skipped without building**: GitHub reports `isPrivate=true`; `.github/workflows/xnu.yml`
  builds only public repositories. Prior public status in the docs does not match
  the live setting. User clarification requested; visibility and the guard have
  not been changed. No 0093 kernel/image or phone result exists.

## Phone result — 0092 RSC/PDC diagnostics, 2026-10-19 16:55 UTC

- Temporary boot only, issued 16:55:16 UTC after the user confirmed fastboot;
  exactly one device, send 0.421s, boot 0.136s, total 0.563s. Image
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0092-rpmhinit.img`, SHA256

  complete cached report is **report 1**, copied below. Later cached reports are
  not independent measurements. No panic marker in the decoded capture.
- **The user confirmed the home screen.**
- **Measured:** pre-write table differs in 34/48 entries; RSC/PDC sequencer
  memory and PDC enable/TCS entries are back to zero, including registers that
  accepted 0091 writes. Thus the 0091 configuration did not persist through this
  user-controlled return to fastboot and temporary boot. This does not identify
  which reset/power transition cleared it. SMMU S2CR3/CBAR3 and GMU RCG also start
  at their ABL defaults on this boot.
- **Measured:** 48 writes, 9 readback mismatches, successful stop handshake
  `RSC_STATUS0=0x01010006`. Three hidden RSCC addresses retain `0x82204514`,
  `0x82204510`, `0x82204520`; all six PDC MSGID differences are exactly bit 3
  (`0x10108 -> 0x10100`). Interpretation and limits: `GPU_GMU_BOOT.md`.
- Other raw checks: firmware 8192/8192 words verified, bad=0; CM3 reset=1,
  busy/init=0, CFG=0x52; CX complete and rolled back, clocks stage=8 restored=1.
  ATOS TTBR=0x104664000, data PA=0x104667000, PTE=0x40000104667f43;
  PARs for 0x60000000/0x60000fff/0x60001000/0x20000000 are respectively
  `0x4000000104667b80`, `0x104667b80`, `0x304667a03`, `0x104667a03`;
  passed=4, FSR=0x400, sGFSR=0. Final SMR/S2CR/SCTLR/CBAR = 0/3/0/0x10000
  (the known inert restore limitation). No GMU or GX execution.

## Latest phone result — 0090 RSC/PDC read-only inventory, 2026-10-18 21:58 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0090-rscpdc.img` (SHA256 `a30aef87…695787`, CI 39169517724,
  sweetgpu=9), fastboot success 0.566s. Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0090-*.
- **No faults: GMU-block RSCC registers and both PDC regions (0x0b290000, 0x0b490000)
  are readable.** RSCC already holds the mainline values PDC_SEQ_START_ADDR=0x4520,
  PDC_MATCH_LO/HI=0x4510/0x4514, PDC_SLAVE_ID_DRV0=1 (HIDDEN_TCS_CMD0_ADDR=
  0x82204514); everything else is zero: RSC_STATUS0 0, OVERRIDE 0, SEQ_BUSY 0,
  SEQ_MEM_0 0, TCS0/TCS3 status 1, RSCC REQ/ACK 0; PDC ENABLE_PDC, SEQ_START,
  TCS0/1/3 banks and SEQ_MEM_0..4 all 0. So ABL/firmware did part of the RSCC setup
  but the PDC/RSC sequencer programming is still missing.
- User did not report the home screen for this boot yet.

## Latest phone result — 0091 mainline RSC/PDC init, 2026-10-18 22:10 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0091-rpmhinit.img` (SHA256 `fde80dfb…b6a4`, CI 39170396365,
  sweetgpu=10), fastboot success 0.560s. Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0091-*.
  Home screen for 0090/0091 not yet reported by the user.
- **All 48 writes issued; 39 read back as written, 9 did not (bad=9). The RSC stop
  handshake completed** (`RSC_STATUS0_DRV0` = 0x01010006, bit 16 set within the
  10 ms bound), i.e. the RSC sequencer ran with the microcode written. First bad
  write: RSCC `HIDDEN_TCS_CMD0_ADDR` (+0x23034) wrote 0, reads back the pre-existing
  0x82204514, so that register appears hardware-owned/ignores writes. The other 8
  were not logged (only the first mismatch was kept) -> 0092 logs all of them.
- No fault; the PDC regions accepted at least some writes. Whether the RSC/PDC state
  persists across a reboot is unknown; 0092 reads the whole table first.

## Active implementation — 0092 RSC/PDC init diagnostics (not yet built/booted)

- `xnu/patches/0092-sweet-gpu-rpmh-init-diagnostics.patch`: same mode 10; logs every
  bad write (first 16) and reads the whole 48-entry init table before writing (prints
  entries that differ from the mainline values: shows persistence). Host tests (62
  cases) pass incl. ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok. Isolated baseline 00095cd (0091).

## Active implementation — 0091 mainline RSC/PDC init (built, phone-tested)

- `xnu/patches/0091-sweet-gpu-rpmh-init.patch`: `sweetgpu=10` performs mainline
  `a6xx_gmu_rpmh_init` for A618 with readback of every write, then the RSC stop
  handshake; leaves the configuration in place. Docs: `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`.
  Host tests (61 cases) pass incl. ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok. Isolated baseline
  8bd13d2 (0090).

## Active implementation — 0090 RSC/PDC read-only inventory (built, phone-tested)

- `xnu/patches/0090-sweet-gpu-rsc-pdc-inventory.patch`: `sweetgpu=9` reads the GPU RSCC
  (gmu+0x23000), RSCC handshake and the two PDC regions before the real mainline
  `a6xx_gmu_rpmh_init` programming is attempted. Host tests (55 cases) pass incl.
  ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok. Isolated baseline f6b7900 (0089). Reference sources
  (mainline v6.12 a6xx_gmu.c/.xml, linux-firmware blobs) are external in `gpu-fw/`.
- Also known: mainline a6xx_gmu_start expects FW_INIT_RESULT 0xbabeface if the DTCM
  word at GMU+0xAFE0 (image offset 0x7fe0) is <= 0x20010004, else (&0x1ff)==0x100.

## Latest phone result — 0089 SMMU write transcript, 2026-10-18 21:44 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0089-smmuctx.img` (SHA256 `f45e1d25…a0ddd3`, CI 39168706195,
  sweetgpu=8); fastboot success 0.567s. Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0089-*.
  (Home screen for this boot not yet confirmed.) ATOS results identical to 0088.
- Transcript (write -> readback): CBA2R3<-1 ok; CBAR3<-0x10000 low bits ok; CB3
  TCR2/TCR/TTBR0/MAIR/SCTLR(0x27) all read back exactly; S2CR3<-3 ok; SMR3<-
  0x80000005 ok (valid bit stuck); restore: SMR3<-0 ok; **S2CR3<-0x200ff and <-0x20000
  both refused (stays 3); CBAR3<-0 and <-0x20000 both refused (stays 0x10000)**;
  CB3 registers (SCTLR/TTBR0/TCR/TCR2/MAIR) all clear again; CBA2R3<-0 accepted.
- Pattern: every refused write has TYPE field value 0 (CBAR) or 2 (S2CR): only
  translate/bypass-type S2CR and stage-1/nested-type CBAR are accepted. Inference,
  not proven.
- **Anomaly:** several 32-bit readbacks of GR0/GR1 registers (SMR/S2CR/CBAR/CBA2R,
  not the CB registers) came back with 0xfffffe3f in bits 63:32 of the 64-bit
  variable although the instruction was `ldr w` (verified in the arm64 object): a
  hardware load cannot do that, so these register pages are probably trapped and
  emulated by the hypervisor with sloppy upper bits. Treat GR0/GR1 reads as 32-bit.
- Net: the SMMU is partly hypervisor-mediated; stream 5 -> CB3 programming works and
  an SMR write of 0 safely deactivates it. Left behind: S2CR3=3, CBAR3=0x10000 with
  SMR3 invalid and SCTLR=0 (inert).

## Active implementation — 0089 SMMU write transcript (built, phone-tested above)

- `xnu/patches/0089-sweet-gpu-smmu-write-transcript.patch`: same `sweetgpu=8`, now
  records each SMMU write with immediate readback and tries inert alternatives for
  S2CR3/CBAR3 if the ABL default is refused. Docs: `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`.
  Host tests (49 cases) pass incl. ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok; isolated baseline
  8be623b (0088).

## Latest phone result — 0088 GMU SMMU context + ATOS, 2026-10-18 21:34 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0088-smmuctx.img` (SHA256 `943ed6d7…e7acd6`, CI 39167833774,
  sweetgpu=8); fastboot success 0.563s; **user confirmed home screen**. Logs outside
  Git: logs/phone-0088-{fastboot.txt,smmuctx.pcap,smmuctx.txt}.
- **The hardware SMMU accepted the page tables.** Table block PA 0x104660000
  (TTBR0 = that), L3[0] = 0x40000104663f43. ATOS (CB3 ATS1PR): 0x60000000 -> PAR
  0x4000000104663b80 and 0x60000fff -> 0x104663b80 (PA 0x104663000 = block+0x3000,
  F=0); 0x60001000 -> PAR 0x304663a03 and 0x20000000 -> 0x104663a03 (F=1, fault).
  4/4 as expected. Caveat: the first PAR has a non-zero high word the second lacks
  for the same page (attr bits stale/unreliable?); FSR after the test = 0x400
  (bit 10, meaning not decoded); sGFSR 0.
- **Restore did NOT fully take:** final SMR3=0x0, SCTLR=0x0 as intended, but
  **S2CR3=0x00000003 (my programmed value, ABL default was 0x000200ff) and
  CBAR3=0x00010000 (programmed; default 0)**; restored=0 was reported, although the
  result line text said "restored" (message bug). State is harmless: SMR3 invalid
  (group inactive) and SCTLR=0. Unknown whether those two writes were rejected by the
  hardware (e.g. CBAR TYPE 0 = stage-2 context while IDR0.S2TS=0; S2CR CBNDX 0xff
  invalid for 5 CBs) or something else; and whether SMR3's valid write ever stuck.
- Home-screen-confirmed, so nothing is broken. **Next (0089):** transcript every SMMU
  write with immediate readback and try alternative "disabled" encodings, to learn
  which values the hardware accepts, before building GMU mappings on top.

## Active implementation — 0088 GMU SMMU context + ATOS check (built, phone-tested above)

- `xnu/patches/0088-sweet-gpu-smmu-gmu-context.patch`: `sweetgpu=8` programs stream 5
  into CB3 with a 4 KiB-granule table (IOVA 0x60000000 -> one page), verifies via
  ATOS, restores. Details: `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`. 0087 home screen was
  confirmed by the user. Host tests (47 cases) pass incl. ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok.
  Isolated baseline bae8544 (0087).

## Latest phone result — 0087 GPU SMMU inventory, 2026-10-18 21:15 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0087-smmu.img` (SHA256 `142dca90…1f50df8`, CI 39165446245,
  sweetgpu=7), fastboot success 0.598s, user put the phone in fastboot. Logs
  outside Git: logs/phone-0087-{fastboot.txt,smmu.pcap,smmu.txt}.
- **No bus fault; the kgsl SMMU (0x05040000) is Linux-visible and readable.** Raw
  values (decode below follows the ARM SMMUv2 manual from memory, not verified):
  sCR0 0x00200626, sCR1/sCR2/sACR 0, IDR0 0x48016605, IDR1 0x20008005, IDR2
  0x00007511, IDR7 0, sGFSR/sGFSYNR0 0; SMR0-4 all 0x00000000 and S2CR0-4 all
  0x000200ff; CBAR0-3 0; CB0 SCTLR/TTBR0/TCR/FSR all 0; +0x6000 = 0x00000178.
- Reading: NUMSMRG=5, NUMCB=5, S2CR TYPE=2 (fault) on every group with no valid SMR,
  all context banks unconfigured: the SMMU is enabled (CLIENTPD=0) and faults every
  stream until we program it. IDR0 suggests stream matching, coherent table walk
  (CTTW) and ATOS support; IDR2 suggests 4/16/64 KiB granules, 48-bit UBS.
  sGFSR clean: nothing has faulted since boot.
- GMU, GMU firmware step and clock rollback identical to 0086. Home screen for this
  boot not yet confirmed.
- **Next:** program stream 5 (GMU) to a context bank with a tiny 4 KiB-granule page
  table and verify with the SMMU's own ATOS translate (no GMU run needed); mainline
  uses one GMU address space, IOVA 0x60000000 dummy page, HFI/log buffers at
  0x60001000+.

## Active implementation — 0087 SMMU read-only inventory (built, phone-tested above)

  reads at 0x05040000). Docs in `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`. 0086 was confirmed to
  reach the home screen by the user.
- Host tests (38 CX/GMU/SMMU cases) pass incl. ASan/UBSan; arm64 compile ok;
  isolated tree baseline 3afeabe (0086).

## Latest phone result — 0086 GMU firmware in TCM, 2026-10-18 20:45 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0086-gmufw.img` (SHA256 `a5804983…0db467`, CI 39164168730,
  commit = HEAD at build, sweetgpu=6), fastboot success 0.564s. CI-generated
  firmware header is byte-identical to the local one. Logs outside Git:
  logs/phone-0086-{fastboot.txt,gmufw.pcap,gmufw.txt}.
- **The 32 KiB GMU firmware (a630_gmu.bin) was written to GMU ITCM+DTCM and read back
  with 0 mismatches of 8192 words**; CM3_SYSRESET was 1 before, CM3 never released,
  clocks/CX/votes rolled back (stage 8). Kernel FNV-1a 0x51c28be8 matches the host
  file. First time GMU memory was written; it also shows the GMU TCM is real
  memory at GMU+0x3000..0xB000.
- Home screen for this boot not yet confirmed by the user.
- **Next (mainline order):** GENERAL_7 TCM retention, RSCC/PDC programming
  (a6xx_rpmh_start), then GMU-visible HFI/log memory (SMMU stream 4/5) before
  releasing CM3 reset.

## Active implementation — 0086 GMU firmware to TCM (built, phone-tested)

- Firmware: linux-firmware `a630_gmu.bin` (32 KiB legacy image; mainline uses it
  for A618). Staged by `xnu/patches/0086-stage-gpu-firmware.sh` (pinned commit +
  sha256), generated header not in git. Local copies in external `gpu-fw/`
  (also mainline a6xx_gmu.c/a6xx_hfi.c v6.12 for the next stages).
- `xnu/patches/0086-sweet-gpu-gmu-firmware-tcm.patch`: `sweetgpu=6` copies it to
  GMU ITCM/DTCM (byte +0x3000) and verifies by readback, only if CM3_SYSRESET==1.
  Host tests pass (32 CX/GMU cases, ASan/UBSan); arm64 compile ok.
- **Remaining GMU boot work (mainline order):** GENERAL_7 TCM retention,
  a6xx_rpmh_start (RSCC + PDC sequences at 0xb290000/0xb490000), HFI table +
  log memory visible to the GMU SMMU stream, CM3_BOOT_CONFIG/CFG(0x4052), release
  reset, wait FW_INIT_RESULT, GFX rail OOB, HFI start.

  sweetgpu=5), fastboot success 0.561s, phone was in fastboot at user's request.
  Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0085-{fastboot.txt,gmureg.pcap,gmureg.txt}.
- **No bus fault; the GMU register block answers.** All 6 reads completed, stage 8,
  clocks/gate/CX/votes rolled back, identical in every replayed report:
  CM3_SYSRESET +0x14000 = **0x00000001** (CM3 held in reset, as expected before
  firmware), CM3_FW_BUSY 0x0, CM3_FW_INIT_RESULT 0x0, CM3_CFG **0x00000052**,
  GENERAL_0 0x0, AO_HOST_IRQ_STATUS 0x0.
- GCC bus branches: memnoc 0x80000220 -> 0x00000221 (running) -> 0x80000220;
  ddrss-axi 0x80000000 -> 0x00000001 (running) -> 0x80000000.
  GMU clocks as in 0084 (cx-gmu 0x00004ff1 on).
- Meaning: CX domain + 200 MHz-config GMU clock + bus branches are sufficient for
  host MMIO to the GMU CSR block. Nothing written to the GMU. Meaning of CM3_CFG
  0x52 not decoded. Home screen not yet confirmed by the user for this boot.
- **Next:** GMU needs SMMU-mapped memory and firmware: map GPU SMMU (0x05040000),
  GMU stream 4/5 contexts, firmware blob location (a618_gmu.bin availability on the
  phone is unverified), then load ITCM/DTCM and release CM3 reset.

## Active implementation — 0085 first GMU register reads (built, phone-tested above)

- `xnu/patches/0085-sweet-gpu-gmu-regs.patch` (on top of 0084): `sweetgpu=5` adds
  GCC memnoc/ddrss-axi branches and reads 6 GMU CX registers; docs in
  `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`. Host tests pass (incl. ASan/UBSan); arm64 compile ok.
  Isolated tree baseline 0a8eef9 (0084).
- 0084 revised was home-screen confirmed by the user. Phone currently in fastboot
  (user put it there) and idle.

## Latest phone result — 0084 revised GMU clock stage, 2026-10-18 20:11 UTC

- `shim/out/shim-boot-0084-gmuclk.img` (SHA256 `b7bd5903…d652e6`, CI 39161422925,
  sweetgpu=4), fastboot success 0.559s; user had the phone in fastboot.
  Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0084b-{fastboot.txt,gmuclk.pcap,gmuclk.txt}.
- **GMU clock came up at 200 MHz config and rolled back cleanly** (all 4 reports
  identical): gate 0x52004 0x01241d7b -> 0x01251d7b (bit16 set); RCG cmd
  0x80000000 / cfg 0x00000000 -> **0x00000602** (source 6, HID 2) with UPDATE
  cleared; cx-gmu CBCR 0x80004220 -> **0x00004ff1** (running, wake/sleep 0xF)
  then 0x80004ff0 after disable; ahb/cxo stayed 0x00000001 (untouched); CX
  collapse and votes released as in 0083. Stage 6, restored=1.
  Caveat: CLK_OFF clear shows the branch sees a running clock; the actual 200 MHz
  rate is not measured. The RCG is left at 0x602 (unused); gate restored.
- USB up, ping ok; only "panic" string is the DumpPanic exec. Home screen not yet
  confirmed by the user for this boot.
- **Next:** 0085 read-only GMU register access under CX+clock (map GMU base
  0x0506a000), starting with a known-safe register, then GMU memory/SMMU.

## 0084 first phone boot — precondition refused, nothing written (2026-10-18 19:59 UTC)

- `shim-boot-0084-gmuclk.img` (SHA e8dca213…c57d8, CI 39160714701, commit
  473ab51) booted via fastboot; **user confirmed home screen**. CX experiment
  repeated cleanly (0xf8222000 then 0x00222001). The GMU clock stage refused:
  my precondition wrongly required ahb/cxo off. Measured instead: GPLL0 mode
  0xd0100005, vote 0x1, gate 0x52004 0x01241d7b, RCG 0x80000000/0x0, CBCR
  ahb/cx-gmu/cxo = 0x00000001/0x80004220/0x00000001. No clock register written.
- Fix (0084 revised, not yet built): leave pre-enabled branches alone; own only
  cx-gmu. Tests updated.

## Active implementation — 0084 GMU clocks (revised after first boot; rebuild pending)

- `xnu/patches/0084-sweet-gpu-gmu-clocks.patch`: `sweetgpu=4` runs a GMU clock
  stage inside the 0083 CX window (GPLL0/2 gate, RCG 200 MHz, ahb/cx-gmu/cxo
  branches), then undoes it. Details: `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`.
- 4 host tests pass (also ASan/UBSan); arm64 object compile 0/1 failed.
  Isolated tree baseline f10f32d (0083).
- **Next:** push, CI, package `shim-boot-0084-gmuclk.img`, boot once with user.

## Latest phone result — 0083 CX power experiment, 2026-10-18 19:47 UTC

- Temporary boot of `shim/out/shim-boot-0083-cx.img` (SHA256 `836062ec…abc451`,
  sweetgpu=3) after the user put the phone in fastboot; success in 0.560s.
  Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0083-{fastboot.txt,cx.pcap,cx.txt}.
- **CX GDSC powered on and rolled back cleanly.** Reports 0-3 (original + 3
  cached replays) all show: GDSCR before `0x00222001`; MX and CX LOW_SVS votes
  both returned 0 (hlvl index 2 each); after clearing SW_COLLAPSE GDSCR became
  **`0xf8222000`** on the first poll (PWR_ON plus the other status bits set)
  and still `0xf8222000` after a 1 ms hold; after SW_COLLAPSE it returned to
  `0x00222001` on the first poll; both releases returned 0.
  First measured successful ARC-vote + CX GDSC power-up on this phone.
- USB ECM up, ping ok, no kernel panic string (only the DumpPanic exec).
  The capture was short (~40 s): only one SpringBoard line; UI not confirmed
  from the log. Phone left running 0083 (temporary boot).
- **Next:** GMU clock bring-up (CX is now known good): GCC GPLL0 divided parent,
  RCG 0x1120, gate 0x52004 bit16, CX GMU branch 0x1098 bit0, with a held CX vote.

## Active implementation — 0083 CX power experiment (built; phone-tested above)

- `xnu/patches/0083-sweet-gpu-cx-experiment.patch`: new ARC vote path in
  sweet_rpmh.c and `sweetgpu=3` in sweet_gpu.c (MX/CX LOW_SVS votes, CX GDSC
  enable, PWR_ON check, full rollback). Details: `docs/GPU_CX_EXPERIMENT.md`.
- Host tests pass (4 tests, also ASan/UBSan); arm64 objects compile (0/2 failed).
  Isolated tree baseline for 0083 is local commit 843344a (0082).
- Implementation **1408d1c** pushed; CI **39159151996 PASSED**. Kernel SHA256
  `de3a8499286902ba07ddc697f9a8337b6746a6882b896fa8bcf97a2af50a8a14` (checksum
  file verified); `_sweet_rpmh_arc_set` and `_sweet_gpu_probe` linked; CI copies
  of sweet_gpu.c/sweet_rpmh.c match the isolated tree. Artifacts `out-0083/`,
  `ci-0083/` (external).
- Images (17,203,200 bytes, ADT identical to 0082): `shim/out/shim-boot-0083-cx.img`
  (sweetgpu=3) SHA256 `836062ec0a3882850ee5e95a42f4f2833395bde632a2a5761ed778932dabc451`,
  and `shim-boot-0083-arc.img` (sweetgpu=2 fallback). Manifest manifest-0083.json.
- **Next:** boot `shim-boot-0083-cx.img` once (first GPU hardware write), using the
  HANDOFF.md capture procedure with phone-0083 file names. Report the lines
  `SWEET GPU: CX experiment ...`. Another agent also uses the phone: coordinate.

## Latest phone result — 0082 ARC inventory, 2026-10-18 19:23 UTC

- Temporary boot of `shim/out/shim-boot-0082-arc.img` (SHA256
  `7fca248b6c8af736aee7982388cb55fedf9d4d825f279ea602007be9fe9cccba`),
  sweetgpu=2. Exactly one fastboot device; success in 0.562s. No flashing.
- USB ECM came up automatically (tools/phone-ecm-host.py); ping 3/3, avg 1.3ms.
  Reports 1, 2, 3 complete; ARC cached tables identical (analyzer passed).
- Raw command-DB levels (uint16, padding included; no checksum/voltage meaning
  claimed). All three resources: aux version 0x1000.
  - gfx.lvl addr 0x00030050, priority 0x40000/0: 0,16,64,128,192,256,0...
  - cx.lvl  addr 0x00030000, priority 0x1440010/0: 0,16,64,128,192,256,0...
  - mx.lvl  addr 0x00030010, priority 0x1440010/0: 0,16,192,320,384,0...
- Only "panic" string in the stream is the DumpPanic process exec; 19
  SpringBoard lines. UI state not separately confirmed by the user.
- Own tcpdump stopped. Logs outside Git: logs/phone-0082-{fastboot.txt,arc.pcap,
  arc.txt,inventory.json}. Phone is running 0082 (temporary boot).
- **Next:** design a bounded opt-in CX/GMU power experiment (ARC vote by table
  index through the shared apps-DRV path, MX parent first). See HANDOFF.md
  hardware notes. Confirm with the user before any hardware write.

**User is switching AI to conserve usage. Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for
the complete continuation context, exact next phone-test commands and all
workspace/source references. 0082 is ready; awaiting fastboot confirmation.
No additional phone action was taken during handoff.**

## Active implementation — read-only ARC inventory 0082

- User said "mehet" after the complete inventory and external-driver audit.
  Added **0082-sweet-gpu-arc-inventory.patch**, modifying only sweet_gpu.c.
  New opt-in **sweetgpu=2** reads clocks plus gfx.lvl/cx.lvl/mx.lvl metadata
  and up to 16 raw uint16 levels per resource from the known firmware locator.
  Modes 0/1 keep their existing mapping behavior. No RPMh RSC/TCS maps,
  voltage helper calls, hardware writes or GPU/GMU/SMMU core mappings.
- Separate bounded parser validates locator/header, entry/auxiliary ranges,
  ARC slave/address type and payload size. Duplicate or malformed resources
  fail explicitly. Raw padding/version/priority/checksum values preserved;
  no checksum verification, corner selection or voltage interpretation.
  Snapshot uses the existing release/acquire publication and cached USB
  reports, including failures. Existing display RPMh helper is unchanged.
- All 3 unit tests pass: 14 clock/cache cases, **30 ARC cases + 512 seeded
  mutations**. Same harness passes ASan/UBSan. Real arm64 object compilation
  passes (0/1 failed), using logs/ci-0081.log and the isolated tree.
  Isolated XNU git baseline through 0081 is **d818e18**; current changes 0082.
- Implementation **6f76e4f15e0f52c65b37d8cf98e647900d5825b0** pushed. Full CI
  **39157726409 PASSED** in 5m02s. Kernel checksum verifies:
  `510f85c8df5a3bff369ab14db41ecc4d91547b28b897ca4c041b58e60aa1afa2`.
  CI GPU/RPMh/USB source and source-list files match local byte for byte;
  both probe/replay symbols linked. Artifacts external out-0082/, ci-0082/.
- Modes 0/1/2 packaged and unpack-verified, each 17,203,200 bytes, with ADT
  identical to validated 0081 and established UFS-root/6-CPU/USB arguments.
  **shim/out/shim-boot-0082-arc.img**, SHA256
  `7fca248b6c8af736aee7982388cb55fedf9d4d825f279ea602007be9fe9cccba`.
  Mode 0 SHA `0f2a1358d27816eebcf12c9257d12f48b8cd7396fe6c1ee9297e7e080d731087`;
  mode 1 SHA `6c8ce3df3842856bc37b1ea538645eeb5676094d05b7b7bb1d18b1658a1c1cab`.
  Manifest shim/out/manifest-0082.json, packaging log logs/boot-package-0082.txt.
- Further pinned-source audit: CX regulator declares MX parent; CX GDSC
  parent is VDD_CX_LEVEL. GMU 200 MHz selects GCC GPLL0 divided parent,
  selector 6/HID 2 at RCG 0x1120; shared gate GCC 0x52004 bit16. Linux
  consumer corner constants add offset1, but DB values are raw and requests
  carry table indices. Recorded in docs/GPU_POWER_SEQUENCE.md. No new writes.
- Details: `docs/GPU_ARC_INVENTORY.md`. Asked user for fastboot availability
  after preparing the verified image; phone remains on validated 0081.
  No 0082 phone experiment yet. Ignored decoder/analyzer prepared under
  research/ for phone-0082-arc capture and per-report ARC table validation.

## Active work — complete inventory and Metal compiler reference

- Patch **0081-sweet-gpu-inventory-replay.patch** is built and phone-tested.
  The user confirmed its first boot reached the home screen. A second boot
  captured all three complete cached GPU inventory reports. The phone is
  left running 0081; no images flashed and no GPU power writes performed.
- Caches the one initial, guarded read-only snapshot and prints it again
  from the existing USB log thread after ~5/15/30 seconds configured-loop
  time. Each report has numbered BEGIN/END markers; replays are explicitly
  marked cached. No new hardware reads, mappings, writes or power votes.
- Immutable snapshot is published release/acquire. No new thread or heap
  allocation. Failure outcomes are cached too. Disabled probing stays quiet.
- Local validation: all 3 unit tests pass (14 MMIO/cache cases in the probe
  harness); real arm64 object generation of GPU and USB C files passes
  (0/2 failed). New tests apply the full GPU patch chain before execution.
- Implementation commit **3fc1124684f2bcf1ac9eebb03f9d18fc5ba9d2e4** is
  pushed. Full CI **39154941656 PASSED** in 7m25s. Kernel checksum verifies;
  GPU/USB/UFS sources and source list match the local tree byte for byte.
  Both GPU probe/replay symbols are linked. Kernel SHA256
  `2f29b0bea5b143f61562417ca346a59896b2370f238a271bf9546de75aacf9c3`.
- Both 0081 images packaged and unpack-verified, each 17,203,200 bytes:
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0081-probe.img` SHA256
  `ad262ff3670fd79b537108b7a2e539d36d49730abb067cd90e514d223cbcc297`;
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0081-default.img` SHA256
  `209b236842959fe3cfd0f71cb3715c9f2ef1c5920dfe69de0e8643c8c075053a`.
  ADT identical to validated 0080; established UFS-root args, cpus=6,
  sweetusb=2, probe mode 1/0. Manifest `shim/out/manifest-0081.json`.
  External artifacts `out-0081/`, `ci-0081/`; logs `logs/ci-0081.log`,
  `logs/boot-package-0081.txt`. Details: `docs/GPU_REPORT_REPLAY.md`.
- 30-second QEMU early-boot check passed: `no_panic_observed`, 0 unknown
  glyphs. Same QEMU ADT, HFS ramdisk and single-CPU arguments as 0080;
  evidence `qemu-0081/boot-local/`. Does not exercise phone USB/GPU/replay.
- Phone results and exact boot/log evidence are recorded below.
- Power/firmware audit added in `docs/GPU_POWER_SEQUENCE.md`, pinned to
  Xiaomi `758bb7ef`: the A618 entry requests **a618_gmu.bin**, unlike the
  mainline SM7150 catalog's a630_gmu.bin. Exact phone firmware unverified.
  GMU startup needs mapped HFI/log buffers before reset release. Source DT
  enables the register-based HFI quirk and GMU streams 4/5. Existing RPMh
  client validates VRM only and its public helper accepts only ldoc11;
  ARC gfx.lvl/cx.lvl/mx.lvl need distinct metadata/table lookup and voting.
  Next independent implementation can expose read-only ARC metadata and
  bounded level tables before designing CX/GMU power writes.
- User suggested Asahi and the open-source NVIDIA Metal driver. Inspected
  NullMoth commit **637282334617d27bccf8aa2448497c0f19465dc8** and upstream
  metal2vulkan **720ef1ce9ae2a2068999a8675717418b9416283e** in separate external
  reference clones. Audit: `docs/GPU_EXTERNAL_DRIVERS.md`. NVIDIA's plugin
  uses the same MetalPluginName/ClassName and initWithAcceleratorPort path
  as our iOS RE. Its macOS MTLIOAccel contracts still need an iOS adaptation.
  Root license is PolyForm Noncommercial; translator licensing is distinct.
- Built upstream metal2vulkan 0.2 CLI (Rust 1.98.0, release, warnings-as-errors)
  in 3m36s. Ran AIR-bitcode compute copy and vertex/fragment translation:
  all **3 SPIR-V modules PASS** CLI verification and spirv-val Vulkan 1.2.
  Synthetic upstream-owned fixtures, vk12-floor reference profile, no phone
  shader execution. Workers bounded to 20s and 500 MiB address space; observed
  0.017s/0.010s, cumulative child RSS high-water 40,724 KiB.
  Rust toolchain isolated at `/home/dipa/.cache/ios-extra-rust/` (external
  drive lacks required symlinks); no shell PATH files changed. Targets,
  smoke artifacts and logs external under `metal2vulkan-target/`,
  `metal2vulkan-smoke/`, `logs/metal2vulkan-build.txt` and saved Cargo.lock.
  This identifies an existing AIR/metallib frontend; real iOS library
  coverage, an Objective-C plugin ABI and Adreno execution remain untested.

## Latest phone result — complete 0081 inventory, 2026-10-18

- Both boots use `shim/out/shim-boot-0081-probe.img`, SHA256
  `ad262ff3670fd79b537108b7a2e539d36d49730abb067cd90e514d223cbcc297`.
  Exactly one fastboot device checked each time; temporary boot only.
- First boot **18:56:07 UTC**, fastboot success in 0.569s; user confirmed
  home screen. Host interface watcher hit usb0 -> enp... rename during
  nmcli and stopped; manual network setup restored ping but missed all
  report windows. 164 packets, 43,128 decoded bytes, 0 capture drops.
  Captured framebuffer swaps, no kernel panic; fitcored/PosterBoard crashes
  present, cause unestablished.
- Added **tools/phone-ecm-host.py** to retry discovery/configuration by ECM
  MAC across rename failures. Manually checked on the live interface and
  successfully exercised automatically during the second boot.
- Second user-authorized boot **19:03:45 UTC**, fastboot success in 0.563s.
  USB ECM host setup succeeded automatically; ping 3/3, no loss, avg 0.780ms.
  Reports **1, 2, 3** have complete matching BEGIN/END markers, 4 GCC values,
  2 GDSCR values and 9 GPUCC clock values each; all cached tables identical.
  This is one original boot measurement replayed, not three samples.
- **CX/GX GDSCR both 0x00222001**: PWR_ON clear, SW_COLLAPSE set. GCC cfg-ahb
  0x00000001; memnoc 0x80000220; snoc-dvm 0x80000001; ddrss-axi 0x00000000.
  All 9 GPUCC branches have halt/off bit31 set. DDRSS software enable is
  clear too; no claim of an owned clock vote from its clear halt bit alone.
  Full raw table: `docs/GPU_REPORT_REPLAY.md`.
- Retry capture: **537 packets, 180,786 decoded bytes, 0 kernel capture
  drops**. SpringBoard/backboardd exec and 16 framebuffer swaps observed;
  no kernel panic marker or crash of those two processes in the capture.
  driverkitd/PosterBoard process crashes observed, cause unestablished.
  The separate explicit user GUI confirmation applies to the first 0081
  boot; second-boot UI evidence here is from the captured stream.
- Existing UDP logger preserved. Stopped only our own tcpdump after reports
  and UI activity; no capture processes left from these two tests.
  Logs outside Git in `ios-extra-work/logs/`: `phone-0081-fastboot.txt`,
  `phone-0081-probe.pcap/.txt`, `phone-0081-retry-fastboot.txt`,
  `phone-0081-retry-probe.pcap/.txt`, `phone-0081-retry-inventory.json`,
  `phone-0081-retry-decode.txt`.
- **Next hardware work:** expose validated read-only ARC command DB metadata
  and level tables for gfx.lvl/cx.lvl/mx.lvl, then design a bounded CX/GMU
  power hold using the source audit and these observed initial states.

## Previous phone result — probe 0080, 2026-10-18

- **Probe 0080 temporary boot PASSED; user confirmed the home screen.**
  Boot started at **18:27:49 UTC**, using
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0080-probe.img`, SHA256
  `7deeb1c9badd6cda5f3e5dcf4959f909680b1b1b1ecf4ee40d05e1651265b5d9`.
  Exactly one fastboot device was detected. `fastboot boot` returned success:
  send 0.420s, boot 0.136s, total 0.562s. No images were flashed.
- The probe completed, USB ECM came up on `enp0s20f0u3u1`, and ping to
  192.168.7.2 returned 3/3 packets, 0% loss, average 0.554ms.
- Logs show HFS root mount, launchd/SpringBoard/backboardd startup and
  framebuffer swaps. No kernel panic or SpringBoard/backboardd crash marker
  was observed in the captured stream. The user separately confirmed GUI
  arrival; this is not inferred merely from process startup.
- Captured GPUCC branches are OFF: CX GMU `0x80004220`, CXO `0x80000001`,
  CX GFX3D `0x80000000`, CX slave `0x80000000`, GX GFX3D `0x80004220`,
  GX CXO `0x80000001`, GX GMU `0x80000000`. The final probe line confirms
  GPU/GMU/SMMU were skipped and no hardware writes were performed.
- **Capture limitation:** live UDP starts partway through the inventory.
  GCC and CX/GX GDSCR raw values are missing; do not infer domain state from
  those absent lines. The precise early-stream loss mechanism is unverified.
- Existing UDP receiver was left running. Used a separate tcpdump capture,
  then stopped only our tcpdump process after the home-screen confirmation:
  621 packets captured, 0 dropped by tcpdump's kernel capture path. This does
  not establish that every UDP datagram was emitted/delivered by the phone.
- Local evidence, kept out of Git, under `ios-extra-work/logs/`:
  `phone-0080-fastboot.txt`, `phone-0080-probe.pcap`,
  `phone-0080-probe.txt` (200,037 bytes). Decoder in this checkout's ignored
  `research/decode-probe-pcap.py`. Other agents' checkout was not edited.
- **Follow-up at this point:** obtain the missing complete power/clock inventory
  (persistent console extraction or a delayed/repeated read-only report)
  before implementing controlled CX/GMU/GX initialization, firmware loading,
  SMMU mappings and the first command-processor memory write. The phone is
  left running this probe kernel at the home screen then. The missing
  inventory was subsequently recovered by 0081 as recorded above.

## Purpose and workspace

- Created 2026-10-18 at the user's request as a separate, initially private
  driver playground. Working experiments can later be ported to `ios-sweet`.
- Local checkout: `/home/dipa/ios-extra`.
- GitHub: https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra.
- **Public with user approval:** the user explicitly said "yes public" on
  2026-10-18. Visibility was changed and verified (`isPrivate=false`).
- Full XNU CI run **39152959124**, source commit
  **ee248d8a46463567d415b0ce4fd83b127c062da3**, **PASSED** (build job 6m15s).
  URL: https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-extra/actions/runs/39152959124.
- Original reference checkout: `/home/dipa/ios-sweet`; do not modify it as
  part of playground work.
- Imported tracked baseline: upstream `347e19018e3e4c0117635e9e444f73659b2ece53`
  (patch 0079, display power), local snapshot commit `919ebb5`.
- Original README and NOTES are preserved in `docs/UPSTREAM_README.md` and
  `docs/UPSTREAM_NOTES.md`. Historical instructions and status in those files
  are reference material; this file and `AGENTS.md` govern current work.

## Initial state

- Kernel patches 0001–0079, shim and tools imported; first experimental GPU
  probe is now patch **0080**. Full GPU driver work is the selected target.
- No ignored build trees, Apple files, device backups, root images or recovery
  images copied. Existing artifacts remain in the reference workspace and
  `/run/media/dipa/android/ios-sweet-work/`.
- The original project has real iOS 16.7.16 userland on XNU, HFS+ on UFS,
  CPU framebuffer rendering, Goodix touch, hardware buttons and USB ECM.
- README/handoff snapshots lag the patch series: 0070/0071 implement app
  navigation fixes; 0078 allows eight CPU cores; 0079 adds framebuffer
  fade-to-black for display-off. Neither the presence of a patch nor a local
  kernel artifact proves its latest phone test passed.
- The initial source/build work did not access the phone; the subsequent
  user-authorized temporary boot and result are recorded above.

## Builds and integration

- `.github/workflows/xnu.yml` retains the inherited build and staging process.
  Its build job runs only when repository visibility is public. The user
  approved publication; public builds are now enabled.
- GPU probe 0080 is implemented, locally cross-compiled, fully CI-linked and
  phone-tested through the home screen. GPU execution remains unimplemented.
- Verified initial push workflow run **39150033548**, head `8b1e4f2`:
  completed with conclusion **skipped**. No macOS build ran while private.
- Verified the imported baseline Git tree exactly matches upstream `347e190`
  (both tree IDs: `032c01bf3fe13ad075a2692611f73b3a200b402d`).
- Keep driver changes focused. Use patch numbers from 0080 here; reconcile
  upstream numbering when porting. Do not automatically merge back upstream.
- Source-level architecture review recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: boot,
  platform/CPU, framebuffer/IOSurface, touch/HID, RPMh/battery, UFS, USB,
  compatibility services and build tooling. The original checkout remains
  at `347e190` with a clean working tree as of setup verification.
- `tools/xnu-cc.py` now infers the runner path from compile logs; explicit
  `XNU_CI_DXB` override is supported. Regression tests cover both repositories.
- GPU research/plan recorded in `docs/GPU_PLAN.md`. Saved live DT identifies
  Adreno 618 `0x06010800`, GPU base `0x05000000`, GPU SMMU `0x05040000`,
  GMU `0x0506a000`, GPUCC `0x05090000`. These are declarations, not tested
  post-ABL register accessibility. Linux/Mesa references are linked in the plan.
- Shared-cache load commands show AppleMetalGLRenderer depends on Metal;
  AGXMetalA11 depends on Metal/IOGPU/IOSurface. The actual usable iOS driver
  integration boundary remains unproven; do not assume GLES bypasses Metal.
- User reminder: other agents work on ios-sweet. Keep edits, generated trees
  and builds isolated here; coordinate future shared-phone tests. No agents
  were spawned and no phone commands were run in this research session.
- **Probe implementation:** `0080-sweet-gpu-probe.patch` adds a read-only
  `sweetgpu=1` GCC/GPUCC inventory, default off. GPUCC mapping is conditional
  on config-AHB enable/halt/invalid checks. GPU/GMU/SMMU remain unmapped because
  no GMU power hold exists. No hardware writes or root-image changes.
- **Isolated tree:** `/run/media/dipa/android/ios-extra-work/buildtree`.
  XNU base `1b191cb58250d0705d8a51287127505aa4bc0789`, fresh pinned provider
  staging, all 79 imported project patches applied plus applicable blacktop
  patches; local baseline commit `788ab36d761b5564db9eaaee63003a7a7e6a5bae`.
  Headers copied from the reference build artifact; source reconstructed
  separately. Downloaded Xiaomi GPU sources pinned to `758bb7ef`.
- **Local results:** syntax and real arm64 Mach-O object compilation of
  `sweet_gpu.c` and its changed `sweet_ufs.c` caller both pass (0/2 failed).
  Objects in `ios-extra-work/objects/`. Imports checked; ARM barrier present.
  Host MMIO tests cover 11 cases; patch reverse-check passes.
- Full register provenance, commands and limitations: `docs/GPU_BRINGUP.md`.
- Probe implementation commit **cdb9295** pushed. Its private-repository CI
  run **39151552639** completed **skipped** as intended. Full kernel linkage
  was not verified at that point. The user subsequently approved publication
  and full kernel build 39152959124 subsequently passed.
- Copied the reference compile log into
  `ios-extra-work/logs/upstream-run28.log`; future local checks can use that
  isolated copy. Final syntax-check log: `ios-extra-work/logs/probe-0080-syntax.txt`.
- **Metal RE:** traced `MTLRegisterDevices` at `0x181b144c8` and
  `getMetalPluginClassForService` at `0x181a3c7c8`. Metal enumerates
  `IOAcceleratorES`, reads `MetalPluginName`/`MetalPluginClassName`, loads an
  Extensions bundle, checks `_MTLDevice` subclassing and invokes
  `initWithAcceleratorPort:`. This is a candidate custom device-plugin
  boundary, not a tested replacement driver. Details in `docs/GPU_API_RE.md`.
- Unit tests pass with ResourceWarning treated as an error after fixing the
  inherited compile-log reader's file lifetime. No phone/device commands run.
- **Full CI artifact verified:** kernel SHA256
  `bd5d3df40badc1bb83571b4a9155fb88fecbc169002133d15ff90a7184c1aad6`.
  `_sweet_gpu_probe` at `0xfffffe00074ee358`. CI copies of all three changed
  files match the isolated local source. Kernel/buildtree artifacts under
  `/run/media/dipa/android/ios-extra-work/{out-0080,ci-0080}/`; full CI log
  in `ios-extra-work/logs/ci-0080.log`.
- **Boot images built and payload-verified:**
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0080-default.img` (`sweetgpu=0`) and
  `shim/out/shim-boot-0080-probe.img` (`sweetgpu=1`), each 17,203,200 bytes.
  High RAM ADT, cpus=6, USB ECM enabled, 30 Hz CPU display. Exact arguments
  and hashes in `shim/out/manifest-0080.json` and `docs/GPU_BRINGUP.md`.
- `shim/out` is an ignored symlink to `ios-extra-work/shim-out`.
  Copied stock DTB and D22 product tree into this checkout's ignored asset
  directories; the other repo was not edited.
- **QEMU 30-second smoke check:** same CI kernel, single-core QEMU ADT and
  copied HFS test ramdisk. Result `no_panic_observed`, unknown_glyphs=0,
  snapshot_only=true; captured kernel/IOKit initialization and CPU/display/HID
  services. Does not establish userspace boot or GPU hardware functionality.
  Results: `ios-extra-work/qemu-0080/boot-local/`; launch log:
  `ios-extra-work/logs/qemu-0080-local.txt`.
- External filesystem cannot bind QMP Unix sockets: first QEMU launch failed
  before executing the guest. Use `/tmp/ios-extra-q0080-*` as QEMU's output
  directory and copy evidence back. Local output path is recorded in
  `ios-extra-work/qemu-0080/local-output-path.txt`.
- Additional Metal RE: `_MTLDevice initWithAcceleratorPort:` is abstract
  (`doesNotRecognizeSelector:`). Ordinary `_MTLDevice init` provides common
  setup; `MTLIOAccelDevice` adds IOAccel device/configuration/shared-memory
  contracts. Evidence and candidate custom-transport implications recorded
  in `docs/GPU_API_RE.md`.
- The phone test above supersedes the earlier pending-test state.
  iOS renderer selection,
  power-up, firmware, SMMU and submission remain future milestones.
  No GPU command execution or upstream integration yet.
