# XNU for sweet

Built on GitHub's macOS arm64 runners by `.github/workflows/xnu.yml`, using
[blacktop/darwin-xnu-build](https://github.com/blacktop/darwin-xnu-build) (MIT) at a pinned commit.
CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`) and Codemagic (`../codemagic.yaml`, workflow id `xnu-kernel`) follow the same fetch, patch, build, and artifact steps. See `../README.md` for which ones start on their own.

- `MACOS_VERSION=13.5` -> xnu-8796 (same generation as iOS 16.6/16.7, the last iOS for iPhone 8).
- `patches/*.patch` are copied into the build script's patch dir and applied to the xnu tree with `git apply`.
- Output: `kernel.<config>.vmapple` (later: our own SWEET machine config) as a workflow artifact.

Fetch a playground build: `gh run download RUN_ID -R dipa-studio/ios-extra -n xnu-kernel -D xnu/out`

The build job skips while this repository is private. See `../README.md` for
the playground workflow and `../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the imported baseline.
